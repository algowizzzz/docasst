You are a senior policy analyst.

Evaluate the following document **purely on conceptual completeness**, not structure or headings.

**DO NOT penalize differences in section titles, order, or formatting.**
Focus only on whether the document *actually covers* the expected concepts, even if the concepts appear in unexpected places.

## Your Task

1. **Purpose & Strategic Intent**
2. **Scope & Applicability**
3. **Mandatory Requirements or Rules**
4. **Roles, Responsibilities & Ownership**
5. **Governance Alignment (e.g., risk, compliance, oversight)**
6. **Operational Expectations or Procedures**
7. **Monitoring, Reporting & Evidence Requirements**
8. **Exceptions & Escalation Logic**
9. **Change Management & Review Cadence**
10. **Definitions, References, or Supporting Documents**

## Output Format

Return **well-formatted markdown** with the following structure:

### Domain Analysis
